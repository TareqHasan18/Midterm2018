Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans:    Data structure is a collection of data values.
        Data structure is needed to organizing and storing data in a system so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
Ans:    Following operations can be performed on the data structures:
        1. Traversing
        2. Searching
        3. Inserting
        4. Deleting
        5. Sorting
        6. Merging

        Compiler Design,
        Operating System,
        Database Management System,
        Statistical analysis package,
        Numerical Analysis,
        Graphics,
        Artificial Intelligence,
        Simulation

what is an Array?
Ans:    An array is a dynamically-created object that serves as a container to hold constant number of values of
        the same type. By declaring an array, memory space is allocated for values of a particular type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans:    Array is a fixed length data structure whose length cannot be modified once array object is created.
        ArrayList is dynamic in nature which means it can resize itself to grow when required.

        The size of an array remains static throughout the program.
        The size of an ArrayList can grow dynamically depending on load and capacity.

        It uses assignment operator to store elements.
        It uses the add() attribute to insert elements.

        It can contain primitives as well as objects of same or different data type.
        Primitives are not allowed in ArrayList. It can only contain object types.

        Arrays and Generics do not go hand in hand.
        Generics are allowed in ArrayList.

        Arrays can be multi-dimensional.
        ArrayList is single dimensional.

        It’s a native programming component where the elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
        It’s a class from the collections framework of Java where the objects are never stored in contiguous locations.

        Length variable is used to determine the length of the Array.
        Size () method is used to determine the size of the ArrayList.

        Takes less memory than ArrayList to store specified elements or objects.
        Takes more memory than the Array to store objects.

        Iterating over an array is faster than iterating over an ArrayList.
        Iterating over an ArrayList is significantly slower in terms of performance.

what is LinkedList?
Ans:    A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
        The elements in a linked list are linked using reference(pointers).

How is an Array different from Linked List?
Ans:    Linked lists store elements at random memory locations whereas arrays store elements in consecutive memory locations.

        Linked list cannot perform random access like arrays because elements are stored at random memory locations
        rather than consecutive locations. So linked lists can be accessed in a sequential manner.

        Insertion and deletion in linked list is easy and performance is effective
        whereas arrays are expensive for such operations because it will shift elements to make a room for another element.

        Linked lists can take additional memory space to store the pointer to its next element.

what is queue?
Ans:    A queue, in computer networking, is a collection of data packets collectively waiting to be transmitted by
        a network device using a per-defined structure methodology.

what is stack?
Ans:    A stack (sometimes called a “push-down stack”) is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items
        and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. This end is commonly referred to as the
        “top.” The end opposite the top is known as the “base.”

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans:    FIFO - First In First Out. example : Queue
        LIFO - Last In First Out. example : Stack

what is the order of complexity?
